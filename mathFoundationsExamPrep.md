## Likely information to include on mathematical foundations test sheet
- Formulas to compute lengh and angle of vector
    - Length: |u| = square root of the squares of each value in the vector
    - angle between two vectors: arccow(a*b/(|a|*|b|))
- equation for characteristic polynomial
    - P(lambda) = det(A - lambda*I) of A
        - i.e. the characteristic polynomial of A is the determinant of A minus lambda times the identity matrix
        - the eigenvalues are the roots of the char. polynomial
- for matrix multiplication (A * B = C) the number of columns in the first matrix (A) must equal the number or rows in the second matrix (B), the output has the number or rows of A and the number of columns of B
    - multiply and add rows of A with columns of B
- quadratic form of matrix
    - Matrix (A) must be square symmetric, i.e. nXn, with each 
    Q_A = x^T * A * x
    - where x is each vector of A
- Description of gradient vector and hessian matrix organization
    - Hessian matrices which are indefinite are saddle points
    - hessian matrices which are negative definite are local maximum
    - hessian matrices which are positive definite are local minimum
- Local linear approximations use taylor polynomial
- Taylor polynomial
    - T_n(f,x_0)(x) = sigma(i=0 to n) (f^(i)(x_0))/i! * (x-x_0)^i
