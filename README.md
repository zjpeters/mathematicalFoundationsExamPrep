# Potential information to include on mathematical foundations test sheet
-Compute the length of a vector: square root of the squares of each value in the vector
```math
\lVert u \rVert = \sqrt{u_1^2 + u_2^2 + ... + u_i^2}
```
- Compute the angle between two vectors: product of the vectors divided by the product of the lengths
```math
\arccos (\frac{a*b}{\lVert a \rVert * \lVert b \rVert})
```
- equation for characteristic polynomial
    - the characteristic polynomial of a matrix $A$ is the determinant of $A$ minus $\lambda$ times the identity matrix    
    $P(\lambda) = det(A - \lambda * I)$


    - the eigenvalues are the roots of the char. polynomial, i.e. the solutions to $\lambda$
- for matrix multiplication ($A * B = C$) the number of columns in the first matrix ($A$) must equal the number or rows in the second matrix ($B$), the output ($C$) has the number or rows of $A$ and the number of columns of $B$
    - multiply and add rows of A with columns of B
- quadratic form of matrix
    - Matrix $A$ must be square symmetric, i.e. $n\times n$, with each 

    $Q_A = x^T * A * x$
    - where x is a vector of length $n$
```math
\begin{pmatrix} x\\ y \end{pmatrix}
```
- Gradient vector and hessian matrix organization
    - Gradient vector is a vector of the first order partial derivatives
    
```math
\nabla f = (\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}, \frac{\partial f}{\partial y})
```
- Hessian matrix is an $n \times n$ matrix containing the second order partial derivatives 
    - Hessian matrices which are indefinite are saddle points
    - hessian matrices which are negative definite are local maximum
    - hessian matrices which are positive definite are local minimum

```math
H_f = \begin{pmatrix} \frac{\partial ^2 f}{\partial x^2} \frac{\partial ^2 f}{\partial x \partial y} \\
                        \frac{\partial ^2 f}{\partial y \partial x} \frac{\partial ^2 f}{\partial y^2}
        \end{pmatrix}
```
- Taylor series/Taylor polynomial
    - If asked to find the linear approximation of a function, calculate the taylor series
    - calculate to $T_n$ where $n$ is the greatest root of the function, i.e. for the function:
    $ x^2 + 3x + 1$
    
    - You would calculate the $T_2$ 
- Taylor polynomial formula
```math
T_n(f,x_0)(x) = \sum_{i=0}^{n}   \frac{f^{i}(x_0)}{i!} * (x-x_0)^i
```

- Chain rule of derivatives
```math
h(x) = f(g(x))\\

h'(x) = f'(g(x)) * g'(x) 
```

- Product rule of derivatives
```math
h(x) = f(x) * g(x)\\
h'(x) = f'(x) * g(x) + f(x) * g'(x)
```
- Integration by parts, inverse to the product rule
```math
\int u\partial v = uv - \int v \partial u
```

- Integration by substitution, inverse to the chain rule

- Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs)
    - First order linear ODE, consider the inhomogeneous ODE:
    $y'(x) + a(x)y(x) = \psi(x)$
    - First, solve the homogeneous solution $y' + a(x)y = 0$, the solution is:
    
    $y(x) = ce^{-A(x)}$

    - Where $A(x) = \int a(x)dx$, and $c$ is a a constant
    - The particular solution $y^*(x)$ can be found by guessing (or systematically)

- i.e. $sin(\pi/6) = 1/2$
- Additionally, to calculate inverse functions such as $arcsin$, $arccos$, $arctan$, use the opposite direction, i.e. $arcsin(1/2) = \pi/6$

## Trigonometric functions
- Periodicity:  $sin(x+2\pi) = sin(x), cos(x+2\pi) = cos(x)$
- Symmetry: $sin(-x) = -sin(x)$
- Pythagorean theorem:
$ sin^2(x) + cos^2(x) = 1 $
- $sin(x+y) = sin(x)cos(y) + cos(x)sin(y)$
- $cos(x+y) = cos(x)cos(y) - sin(x)sin(y)$
